# Superstore 

## Purpose 
The purpose of this analysis is to derive insights on Superstore's sales, cost of sales, and profitability.

## Analysis 
After visualizing the data, I concluded the following: 
* Superstore offered discounts on products that were so large that they ended up making less than $0 in profit on those products.
* Discounts were provided to unprofitable customers.
* Superstore does not have very many customers (<100) from certain states.

## Summary 
One of the major issues with Superstore is that they're operating at a loss in certain states because of the discounts that they're offering. Superstore may want to limit discounts so that theyâ€™re only applicable to profitable products, discontinue the sale of unprofitable products and/or provide tiered discounts to customers based on how much they spend. 

I recommend that a market basket and financial analysis be conducted to understand the financial impact of discontinuing certain products and whether the sale of certain unprofitable products are typically purchased with products that are significantly profitable. 

Superstore may want to conduct market research and target expansion in regions that they currently don't have many customers in but have high potential in terms of growth.
